                <p >Bihar Vidhan Parishad, also known as Bihar Legislative Council, is the upper house of the bicameral legislature of the state of Bihar.The first sitting of the Council was convened on 20th January, 1913 at Bankipore. The current strength of the council is 75.

Bihar Chief Minister Nitish Kumar, in October, 2017 launched a statewide campaign to abolish child marriage and dowry, drawing strength from the campaign he had launched in the previous year to make the state alcohol-free.

In October, 2017, Bihar ranked second in the country after neighbouring Uttar Pradesh when it came to dowry-related cases. In 2016, 987 cases of dowry deaths were registered in Bihar, while the number of cases of dowry-related atrocities was 4,852, and the percentage of child marriage cases in the state stood at 39.

Deputy Chief Minister Sushil Kumar Modi asked Hon'ble CM to introduce a stringent law to deal with the issue of child marriage and suggested him to enact a legislation, under which the elected representatives of the panchayats would be held responsible if a child marriage was reported from their respective jurisdictions.

These social evils affect all strata of the society and we believe awareness among the youth is essential and inputs from them can be of great help to formulate effective policies in this regard.</p>

Past events and foregone occurrences continue to lodge a prominent influence on how the mind-set of young leaders is channelled. Keeping in mind the same notion as one of the pivotal foundations to our coming conference, we have the "Historical Crisis Committee".

An important genre of Policy Making is Crisis Management, and to explore it, to experience the thrill of spontaneity, to measure the limits of the young minds, to understand their response to the highlights of our nation's past, we expect this committee to play a vital role.

The agenda will be released 7-10 Days before the summit.

A timeline will be set and crises will be presented in chronological order. On solving each crisis, the next one will be served to the committee.

The basic purpose of the Indian Constitution was to uplift the marginalised community. The constitution indeed works for that and realise fundamental rights to empower the people which would ensure economic and social democracy. Intense effort has been made to guarantee equality to the disadvantaged sections of the population through constitutional provisions aimed at preventing discrimination and promoting social justice. 

Empowerment is the enhancement of the political, social, economic or spiritual strength of individuals and communities. Empowerment envelops developing and building capacities of individuals, communities to make them part of the main stream society. 

Through this committee we aim to review and improvise policies made for inclusion and empowerment of marginalised sections of our society. Through interaction with the youth, we aim to come up with a policy to effectively execute this dream of the founding fathers of the nation.

                It will be a platform for listening and discussing the grievances of Senior Citizens. Discussion will take place on various government schemes available for senior citizens.

This will be the first time when students will deliberate over the needs of the Senior Citizens with them, and hence assist in tackling loneliness and the problem of not being heard.

Our target group will be mostly retired government servants, farmers and other people in need of attention from the society. Their problems shall be noted and forwarded for action to concerned government departments.
 
Suggestions, based on this committee, will be made for effective formulation of Bihar Vriddh Jan Niti, proposed under Programs for Good Governance of the Government of Bihar.
